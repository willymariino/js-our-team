[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/live-demo-brightgreen)](https://js-our-team.netlify.app/)

## Project Overview
This project is a JavaScript-based web application that dynamically generates a responsive team page. 
All team members data is stored in an array of objects and rendered on the page at runtime using DOM manipulation. 
The exercise focuses on separating data and layout logic, while building a maintainable structure for displaying user profiles. 
Each team member is displayed as a card, generated dynamically when the page loads.

## Features

**Data-Driven Content**: Team member informations (name, role, image, email) are stored in an array of objects.
**Dynamic Rendering**: Cards are created and inserted into the page using JavaScript.
**Responsive Layout**: The page adapts to different screen sizes for better usability.
**Separation of Concerns**: HTML structure and JS logic are clearly divided.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5**
